# Breast-Tumor-Prediction
Levaraging Machine Learning models to predict the tumor to be Malign or Benign
A breast cancer prediction machine learning project aims to build a model that can predict the likelihood of a person developing breast cancer, based on a set of features. The model can be trained on data that includes information about individuals who have or have not developed breast cancer, along with various features that might be associated with the development of the disease. These features could include demographic data (such as age, gender, and race), lifestyle factors (such as diet and exercise habits), and medical history (such as the presence of certain genetic mutations or previous diagnoses of breast abnormalities). Once trained, the model can be used to predict the likelihood of breast cancer in new individuals, based on their feature data. This type of model could be used to help identify individuals who may be at higher risk of developing breast cancer and could benefit from early detection and prevention efforts.
